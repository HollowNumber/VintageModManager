VintageModManager is a Rust-based application designed to manage and organize mods for Vintage Story. This project aims
to provide a comprehensive solution for mod management, including features such as mod list parsing, auto downloading as
well as updating mods. 

## Project Status

**Note:** This project is currently under development and is not yet finished. Many features are still being
implemented, and the codebase is subject to significant changes. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we continue
to improve and expand the functionality of VintageModManager.

## Features

- **Mod Information Handling:** Parse and manage mod information from JSON data.
- **Mod Downloading:** Download mods from the Vintage Story moddb api.
- **Mod Exporting**: Export your mods to a shareable string that can be imported by other users.

## Installation

To build and run the project, you need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust by following the instructions on
the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VintageModManager.git
    cd VintageModManager
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```sh
    cargo build
    ```

3. Run the project:
    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

## Usage

The application is currently in development, and the CLI is subject to change.

To start download the newest version of the cli from
the [releases page](https://github.com/HollowNumber/VintageModManager/releases)

To see the available commands and options, run the following command:

```sh
VintageModManager --help
```

or the shorthand

```sh
VintageModManager -h
```

All commands have their own help page, which can be accessed by running the command with the `--help` flag.

```sh
VintageModManager <command> --help
```

### Examples

To export your mods to a shareable string:

```sh
VintageModManager export
```

To import mods from a shareable string:

```sh
VintageModManager download <mod_string>
```

Where `<mod_string>` is the string you received from the export command.

To download a mod:

```sh
VintageModManager download <mod_id>
```

Where `<mod_id>` is the ID of the mod you want to download. This can be found on the moddb page of the mod.

To update a mod:

```sh
VintageModManager update <mod_id>
```

Where `<mod_id>` is the ID of the mod you want to update. This can be found on the moddb page of the mod.

Note: Default behavior is to update all mods. So unless you specify a mod id, all mods will be updated.

## Roadmap
