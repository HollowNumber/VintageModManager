implemented, and the codebase is subject to significant changes. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we continue
to improve and expand the functionality of VintageModManager.

## Features

- **Mod String Encoding/Decoding:** Encode and decode mod strings using base64 encoding.
- **Mod Information Handling:** Parse and manage mod information from JSON data.
- **Mod Downloading:** Download mods from the Vintage Story moddb api.
